\section{Data}
\label{S:D5}
Five types of variables were generated from the collected crossing behaviour data: 1) crossing variables: crossing duration (time from initiating the crossing until the crossing was completed), waiting time duration (the time from the start of the trial where the participant was standing on the sidewalk until the crossing was initiated), crossing speed, and initial walk speed, 2) distraction attributes: percentage of the time the head was facing the smartphone during wait time, percentage of the time the head was facing the smartphone while crossing, number of times the head was facing the smartphone over the total trial duration, maze solving time (the time it takes for a participant to solve one maze in the smartphone) , 3) safety measures: TTC (calculated for each second between vehicles and the pedestrian as the time until they would collide if their direction and speed remain unchanged), PET (the time difference between when the pedestrian departs the conflict point and the time vehicle arrives at that point), average and maximum acceleration and deceleration, the percentage of successful and time-out trials, 4) sociodemographic information: age, gender, number of years they owned a smartphone, having a driving license, and 5) gap variables: missing gaps before initiating crossing, and chosen gap for crossing. \cref{tab:D1} presents the mean value of the attributes. As it can be seen in this table, in the sample data collected, waiting time increases when participants are distracted. In the sample being studied, LED lights have caused females to wait slightly longer before crossing while distracted. However, Males waiting time has decreased a bit using LED lights. In all three scenarios, females have longer waiting times.
