This chapter is organized as follows:

\cref{A:brake} explains the designed braking levels of various types of simulated vehicles in the virtual reality experiment used in \cref{chap4} abd \cref{chap6}.

\cref{A:var} provides a list of all the collected variables in the virtual reality experiment of \cref{chap4} and \cref{chap6}.

\cref{A:design} provides the design of experiment, which is developed as an extension of D-Optimal design for Cox Proportional Hazards model for two covariates.

\cref{A:data} gives insight about the descriptive statistics of the covariates, and lists the wait time statistics for different levels of covariates.
