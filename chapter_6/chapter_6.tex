\section*{Preamble}
This chapter features another aspect of the pedestrian crossing behaviour in automated environments of future urban space: trajectory. Utilizing data retrieved from the same virtual reality experiment described in the previous chapter, data-driven time-series models are developed to predict the trajectory of pedestrians while crossing roads confronting automated vehicles. The model uses the initial movements of pedestrians, as well as their head orientations and distance to the coming vehicle as input, and merges them with contextual information of the environment to predict the location of the next steps of pedestrians. All the input to the models are set in a way that can be captured by a hypothetical automated vehicles, making it possible to predict the movements of pedestrians based on the information that are available to a typical automated vehicle. This chapter also include an extensive review of the available open-source datasets related to real test automated vehicles on the roads, and discusses their drawbacks and advantages from a pedestrian-oriented point of view.
